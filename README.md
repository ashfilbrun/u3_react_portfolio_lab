# React Portfolio Lab


We're here for a reason, and that reason certainly ain't hearing Jeremy's lame dad jokes

We're here to enter the world of professional software engineering and coding. There are a few things that we will need to enter the field: A resume, a LinkedIn, and of course, a solid Portfolio site. 

We are going to spend the next block working in conjunction with Outcomes to help build up our portfolio sites.

This is *not* something you are going to finish up in 2 hours. In fact, it something that you are going to continue working on and updating even after you deploy it online.

Take your time to plan out some wireframes and think of how you want to style your site

### Steps

- Create a new repo in your personal github account
- Create a Component Hierarchy Diagram and a Wireframe design of how you'd like your Portfolio to look and operate
- Create the basic skeleton of your React App and necessary Components
- Populate your components with necessary data
- Deploy and share with family and friends!


### Requirements

There is no standard way to build up a Portfolio, but we'd *highly* recommend having components for a Nav bar to get around the site (We will build this up more in our Router I lesson!), an About Me, which may or may not be your landing page, a component for your Resume, a Contact page, one to hold your Projects in, and a component for each project (You can add more as you build more of course!)

We want you to take your time on this and not rush something so important. Having this "complete" will not be required as a deliverable for homework, we just want to see the initial set up, plus your prep and wireframes. 

A professional, beautiful, and deployed Portfolio is going to be required to complete Outcomes at the end of the course, and for your job search process, so take your time in planning and building up what you want to do, take the time now to get the first steps set, and create something you can really show off and be proud of!
